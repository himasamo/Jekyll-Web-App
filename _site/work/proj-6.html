<p class="text">Pioneering transportation app Uber has announced a new logo design â€“ or rather two app icons, with one for the 'rider' app, and one for the app used by drivers, or 'partners'.
Controversially, the company has removed the familiar 'U' element of the design (or knocked it on its side), just months after the largest tech brand in the world, Alphabet, made the 'G' a more prominent part of the Google logo.</p>
